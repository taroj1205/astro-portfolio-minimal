This is a minimal portfolio template built with Astro. It includes a simple landing page with a list of experiences and link to about page, and projects.

### Features

- Simple landing page with a list of projects
- About page with more details about me
- Projects page with a list of projects

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Start the development server with `pnpm run dev`
4. Open the website in your browser at <http://localhost:3000>

### Customizing

You can customize the website by modifying the files in the `src` directory. The `src/pages` directory contains the pages for the website, and the `src/components` directory contains the components used in the pages.

You can also customize the styles by modifying the `src/styles/global.css` file.

### Deploying

You can deploy the website to a hosting platform like Netlify or Vercel. You can also deploy it to a static site generator like GitHub Pages.
